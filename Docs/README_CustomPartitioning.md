# Disk Customization

As of this document's author-date (2020-01-29), the AMIgen7 scripts now support the _optional_ creation of AMIs with customized storage-layouts and filesystem sizes.

## Usage

The _default behavior_ for AMIgen7 remains creating AMIs with the following storage-layout:

Root EBS of 20GiB size partitioned as:

* 1st partition: 512MiB primary partition mounted at `/boot`
* 2nd partition: 19.5GiB primary partition placed under the control of LVM2:
    * 4GiB filesystem on `rootVol` LVM volume mounted at `/`
    * 2GiB filesystem on `swapVol` LVM volume mounted as swap
    * 1GiB filesystem on `homeVol` LVM volume mounted at `/home`
    * 2GiB filesystem on `varVol` LVM volume mounted at `/var`
    * 2GiB filesystem on `logVol` LVM volume mounted at `/var/log`
    * &cong;8.5GiB filesystem on `auditVol` LVM volume mounted at `/var/log/audit`

This ensures that any downstream projects that rely on &ndash; or even merely "expect" &ndash; the prior layout will continue to function without modification

To change the storage layout<sup>[1](#Footnote1)</sup>, it will be necessary to:

1. Select an appropriately-sized EBS volume to build onto
1. Invoke the `DiskSetup.sh` utility with the `-p` flag with an argument-string that looks similar to:

    `/:rootVol:8,swap:swapVol:4,/opt:optVol:20,/var:varVol:8,/var/log/audit:auditVol:100%FREE`

    The string is a comma-delimited list of colon-delimited value-triplets where:

    * First Value: path to mount the filesystem to
    * Second Value: name to assign to the LVM2 volume hosting the filesystem
    * Third Value: size (in GiB) of the LVM2 volume and associated filesystem to create

    Any valid group of value-triplets that fit within the size of the EBS selected in the firt step should work. To avoid wasting disk space, it is recommended that one value-triplet substitute the value `FREE` or `100%FREE` for the numerical value<sup>[2](#Footnote2)</sup>.
    
1. Invoke the `MkChrootTree.sh` utility with third argument-string identical to the one passed to the `DiskSetup.sh` utility
1. Invoke the remaining utilities as normal for the relevant deployment-context 

## Notes:

<a name="Footnote1">1</a>: If one wishes to main compliant with the STIGs' partitioning-specitication, it will be necessary to ensure that the customized-layout also includes all the filesystems enumerated in the default behavior section.

<a name="Footnote2">2</a>: To date, this has only been tested with the `/var/log/audit`/`auditVol` filesystem/volume
